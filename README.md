# Time_Travel
A complete comprehensive guide on everything about Time series Analysis and Forecasting.

## Why this repository?
The four contributors to this repository participated in a competition, where the objective was to analyse and forecast sales data for the upcoming year on the basis of given data of past 7 years, for 4000 different regions. Whereas we ended up submitting the code on there using an LSTM model, this is everything we learned about different methods used for evaluating time series along the way, and where and why exactly they should be applied.

Having understood what exactly a Time Series is and how it should be evaluated, let us look at the frequent methods used to forecast them.
