# Introduction

## What is time series data ?
   Time series data is data that is collected at different points of time unlike normal data that we find in most of the datasets which is measured at a single point of time ; time series data is collected at adjacent time periods and thus there is a possibility of correlation between the observations.This adds another dimensionality to data a <b>Time</b> dimension.This is one of the special features that distinguises time series data from normal data .Time series data is normally recorded at regular intervals(eg Hourly,Monthly ,Weekly etc) and this is the most common case known as  <b>Regular Time Series</b>.However this is not true all the time and sometimes time series data is recorded at irregular intervals and this is called <b>Irregular Time Series</b> we'll focus on regular time series for now.
